# Question Classifier

This repository contains a Python program that uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to build a machine learning model for classifying questions based on their content. Specifically, it determines whether a question is related to stock performance or not.

## Introduction

This project aims to demonstrate a simple implementation of a text classification task using Python's OOP features and a basic machine learning model. The classifier is designed to predict whether a question pertains to stock performance based on the presence of specific keywords.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of a collection of questions and their corresponding correct answers. The data is provided in an Excel file named `Q-A-Rag.xlsx`. The relevant columns are:

- `Question`: The question text.
- `correct_answer`: The correct answer to the question.

## Installation

To run this project, you need Python 3.x and the following Python packages:

- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```
